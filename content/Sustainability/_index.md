On this page I will share information and our own practices of sustainability. We believe it's important to care for our environment, including caring for the plants, animals, and people that live in it. We intentionally try to live with sustainability in mind, but also find it very important not to loose sight of enjoying life. We're not saints and we will never be saints. But step by step we can still try to improve. 

Please note that I write both informational pieces, and pages containing our personal experience. I try to research and verify anything that is stated as a fact. My personal opinions however, are of course less evidence based. Feel free to tell me your experiences, I'd love to hear if they are similar or completely different. Let's learn together and keep the conversation going.
