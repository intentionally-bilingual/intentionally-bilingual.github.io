In this post I will talk about what sustainability is. You might be surprised it's more than just caring for the planet, at least I was. 

First, the word itself. It's a word that is used more and more these days, and mostly in the way of people trying to put their best foot forward and improve their way of living for the good of the environment. There are however more parts to sustainability than that. When looking at the dictionary meaning, sustainability is the quality of being able to continue over a period of time. Super vague, I know. 

# Three pillars of sustainability
The term sustainability encompasses 3 categories or pillars of sustainability, being social, economic, and environmental. The last one being the one that we hear most often. I'll shortly explain them below and conclude with what we do ourselves. 

The United Nations have put several goals in place about sustainability in all pillars. I think they are are fair representation of what sustainability is all about, so I will mention them in each of the three sections.

## Social
When put to social issues, sustainability is all about caring for the people on this planet. Often this is seen from a business perspective, but can also be seen from national/global structures and individual practices. 

The United Nations goals for social sustainability include: no hunger, no poverty, health and wellbeing, quality education, gender equality, no inequality whatsoever, peace, justice, dignity and fair work. 

## Economic
From an economic perspective, sustainabilty is a bit more tricky or controversial. Not everything that is good for economical growth, is neccesarily good for people or the environment. However, not having enough economic sustainabilty cand actually hinder the other pillars. Some development is needed to e.g. fight world hunger, innovate for greener electricity and so on. 

The United Nations have a few economic goals stated. These are economic growth with fair work, and stimulating industrialisation and  innovation. Fighting poverty is also both a social and an economic value. 

## Environmental
When put into the environmental pillar, the meaning of sustainability can be explained by caring for the planet itself. This mainly boils down to not using resources that cannot be replace and/or damage the environment. 

United Nations goals that belong to this category are including: clean water, clean energy, responsible consumption and production, climate action, biodiversity, and sustainable cities. 

 in such a way that products athe idea that goods and services should be produced in ways that do not use resources that cannot be replaced and do not damage the environment". Personally, I'd like to say "planet friendly", as in friendly for the planet itself but also its inhabitants. Creating a world that is still there for our kids and grandkids to enjoy. Sustainability also includes terms like animal friendly, biodiversity, zero waste, organic, recycling, and other practices.

## What we do

What we do in a nutshell:
- We are mostly vegetarian and try to limit dairy for several reasons.
- We often eat organic, though are fine with GMO so will also eat that.
- We opt for reusable when possible, such as washable diapers, female hygiene, and cloths, and all things container wise in the kitchen :)
- We choose natural and basic toys for our children when we can, mostly wood or fabric.
- Recycling is done, into the main categories
- We try to move towards zero-wase and zero-plastic, but are only starting this. Mainly washing bars and powders instead of bottles.
- Improved the house in insulation, solar panels, lots of green, cut down gas when possible
- Opt for the bike or public transport when possible
- invest in memories instead of stuff, and invest in quality materials over flimsy stuff that breaks in a second.
- Browse through second-hand options when wanting to buy anything, including small furniture, clothes, toys

What we don't do:
- make a fuss about what others are doing, if they are not interested in doing anything else
- limit ourselves in such a way that we're not living anymore. You've got to enjoy life
- feel guilty about fuckups, as long as the intentions were good
