On this page you can find information and most of all experiences of our life as parents. We believe in following our children in what they need and encouriging as much independance as possible. We do this mainly by following the Montessori way of parenting, but also change and add things to suit our own way of being. Feel free to roam about and learn more about Montessori parenting and our experiences as a family of four. 

Please keep in mind that these posts are mainly our own experience, and in no way portray the ONLY good way to parent. We respect other opinions and ways of living, so please do the same to us. Feel free to disagree with anything written and I'd like to invite you to discuss with me if you want to express your thoughts. Wherever possible, I try to include facts and research-based information in order to give more background and reasons why we believe what we believe.
