A child's language development follows general patterns. This is for both monolingual children and bilingual or multilingual children. However, there are some differences between these patterns. In this series you can read more about this language development or acquisition of a child, both monolingual and multilingual. The topics are divided into different stages, each with three parts. One for monolingual development (MFLA), one for simultaneous multilingual development (BFLA) and one for sequential multilingual development (SLA).

Before you dive into the stages, I made an introductory page about the different stages I will mention and the most used defining terms. If at any later stage you donâ€™t understand the abbreviations used, go check them out again!
