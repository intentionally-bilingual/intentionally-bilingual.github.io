Did you know that once a relationship between people has been started in a particular language, it is very hard to change this at a later time? For most people, speaking a different language than normally spoken with a ceertain person, feels awkward and somewhat wrong. This page is all about that phenomenon, which all has to do with relational languages.

## The concept
It seems that my husband and I are one of the few that have changed our language use drastically within a single day. Of course we had some minor troubles getting used to the new language between us, but nothing that lasted more than a few weeks. We are both Dutch and have been raised monolingually Dutch by our parents (albeit with some extra dialect around us). Changing to English was done as a conscious decision, after which we immediately switched. It took us two sentences to start, and a few days of Dutch when tired or angry, but now we've been speaking English with each other for about 4 years already. 

When looking at my other relationships though, I still find it very difficult sometimes. One example is my parents, even though I only speak English to my daughter, it's very hard to do so in the presence of my parents. My brain automatically sets back to Dutch when I see them, especially in their home. The language I have spoken with them for nearly 30 years is hard to change, even if I'm not even adressing them per se.
