On this page I will talk about Dyslexia and what this means for bilingualism or learning another language. As this is not one of the usual topics within speech therapy, I have no professional experience with it. My husband does have dyslexia though, and through him I've gained some perspective to what it means for someone to have it. His dyslexia and struggles to learn new languages has also been one of the main reasons of why we raise our own children bilingually.
