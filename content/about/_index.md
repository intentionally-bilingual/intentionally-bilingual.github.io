Nice to meet you! I am Nimke Nijhof, a Dutch speech and language therapist, and English speaking mom to two bilingual daughters.

As a therapist, I help children with developmental disabilities and or autism communicate, in whatever way possible. This includes direct therapy sessions and also advising parent on how to stimulate language development in often challenging circumstances. In recent years I have specialised in bilingualism and cultural diversity. This both in normally developing children and in children with special needs.

As a mom, I raise my daughters as growing bilinguals. While both my husband and I are born and raised in a Dutch monolingual environment, we are now an English speaking family in the comfort of our home (combined with signs). This Intentional Bilingualism (or non-native bilingualism) isnâ€™t without its struggles, doubts and judgements. Often these are external. However, our bilingual journey is definitely worth the effort.

As parents and also just as people, my husband and I try to live with intention. Next to bilingualism, this means that we try to raise our children and ourselves with care for our environment. Montessori parenting, sustainability and mental health are a big part of our lives.

On this website I write about our own personal experiences, but also create informational pieces on bilingualism and living with intention for all people that are interested. Most of my content is also available on my Instagram account, which you can check out via the contact page.
